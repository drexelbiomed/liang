<p><b><font size="6">Postdoctoral Positions Available </font></b> </p>
<p>Postdoctoral positions are currently available to participate in an ongoing research 
project that analyzes large time series datasets being gathered under various 
tasks including visual selective attention, multistable visual perception and 
visuomotor pattern discrimination etc. The project involves the development and 
application of modern signal processing techniques to multielectrode neural 
recordings. The successful candidates should be highly motivated, and are 
expected to work in a team, with the opportunity to work with distinguished 
collaborators in neural data acquisition, analysis, and algorithm development. </p>
<p>The ideal candidate should have, or be about to receive, a Ph.D. in a 
relevant discipline with substantial mathematical/computational experience 
(especially in signal processing, time series analysis, dynamical systems, 
multivariate statistics). Programming skills in C and Matlab are essential. 
Experience in neuroscience is advantageous but not required. </p>
<p>Interested individuals should email a curriculum vitae, a brief statement of 
research interests, the expected date of availability and the names of three 
references to Dr. Hualou Liang at <a href="mailto:Hualou.Liang@drexel.edu">
Hualou.Liang@drexel.edu</a> </p>
