<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The understanding of bottom-up and top-down influences in the 
visual cortex is of great theoretical importance. A number of elaborate theories 
of visual cortical function have been devised that posit separate roles for 
bottom-up and top-down effects. We used Local Field Potentials (LFPs), recorded 
from different visual cortical areas, as a means to explore these effects 
experimentally. The Directed Transfer Function (DTF), a statistical measure of 
directional influences in time series data based on multivariate autoregressive 
modeling, was used to disambiguate directional influences in the visual cortex. 
The DTF was computed from LFPs recorded from sites in different parts of the 
visual cortex of macaque monkeys performing a visuomotor pattern discrimination 
task. DTF analysis was performed in 50 msec long windows that were stepped point 
by point over the length of the trial. In each window, a DTF spectrum was 
computed over the range of 0 to 100 Hz for all pairwise combinations of 
recording sites, and in both directions for each pair. One site was considered 
to exert a causal influence on another whenever a significant rise in the DTF 
occurred as compared to the prestimulus baseline level. Bottom-up causal 
influences were those that were exerted from striate to extrastriate sites, and 
top-down influences were those exerted from extrastriate to striate sites. 
Separate bottom-up and top-down causal influences could be observed in the 
visual cortex as different DTF time courses. In some cases, the top-down 
influence preceded the bottom-up, suggesting that a top-down priming influence 
was exerted in these highly trained monkeys prior to actual stimulus processing. 
A rapid alternation of predominance between bottom-up and top-down influences 
was observed during the time of stimulus processing, suggesting that reciprocal 
influences may play a crucial role in visual pattern discrimination, as proposed 
by several theories of visual perception. </p>
