<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prefrontal cortex is involved in many executive 
functions, including anticipation. Prefrontal activity may tune neural 
populations in sensory areas for rapid stimulus and response processing. Several 
studies have related the level of rhythmic synchronization at different 
frequencies during anticipatory periods to the amplitude and latency of early 
event-related potential (ERP) components and reaction time (RT); some have 
implicated the prefrontal cortex in anticipatory processing. However, evidence 
on the organization of anticipatory prefrontal activity, and on whether the 
prefrontal cortex exerts anticipatory top-down effects on sensory areas, has not 
been available. To address these questions, we performed power, coherence and 
DTF (measuring causal influence) spectral analysis on local field potentials 
simultaneously recorded at distributed sites in one hemisphere of a macaque 
monkey performing a visual pattern discrimination task. The measures were 
computed in trial sets rank ordered by RT. During the prestimulus period, we 
found a distributed prefrontal network synchronized in the beta frequency range. 
Network power and coherence varied inversely with RT, suggesting an anticipatory 
function, and were correlated with N1 peak amplitude and latency of ERPs in 
visual areas, suggesting an effect on stimulus processing. A prefrontal top-down 
influence on stimulus processing was suggested by the correlation of prestimulus 
prefrontal-to-visual DTF with N1 peak amplitude and latency at the same visual 
sites. The results imply that large-scale prefrontal networks exert anticipatory 
bias on visual cortical areas to facilitate their stimulus processing. Supported
