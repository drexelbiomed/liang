<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Evidence from a number of sources indicates that a 
large-scale network of interconnected cortical and subcortical areas subserves 
the ability to direct attention to behaviorally relevant targets in 
extrapersonal space. Highly trained rhesus macaque monkeys performed a visual 
pattern discrimination task. Each trial was initiated when the monkey depressed 
a lever with the preferred hand. Computer-generated presentation of the visual 
stimulus began approximately 115 msec later. Surface-to-depth local 
event-related field potentials were recorded at distributed sites in the 
hemisphere contralateral to the performing hand on thousands of trials. We 
performed dynamic spectral analysis of the field potentials based on Adaptive 
MultiVariate AutoRegressive modeling. Spectral power, ordinary coherence and 
phase, multiple coherence, partial coherence, and directed transfer function 
measures were used to characterize the dynamics of field potential 
interdependency during the prestimulus period when the monkeys were attending to 
the computer screen in anticipation of stimulus presentation. The results 
indicate that a large-scale network of distributed cortical areas is coordinated 
in anticipation of stimulus appearance. This coordination occurs in the 20-30 Hz 
frequency range and involves sites in posterior parietal, somatosensory, and 
motor areas. Following stimulus presentation, this network undergoes a 
transition in which some of its component sites are recruited into another 
network that arises initially in visual cortical areas that perform visual 
feature processing functions. Supported by NSF Grant IBN9723240 and NIMH Grants
