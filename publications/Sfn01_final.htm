<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has recently been shown that gamma band (35-90&nbsp;Hz) 
synchronization is enhanced among V4 neurons activated by an attended stimulus 
as compared to neurons activated by distracters (Fries et al, Science, 2001). 
Here, we investigated the detailed time course of this attentional modulation by 
Adaptive MultiVariate AutoRegressive (AMVAR) modeling (Ding et al, Biol Cyber, 
2000). For multiple simultaneously recorded local field potentials from V4, we 
obtained power and coherence spectra in 50&nbsp;ms windows shifted over the data in 
millisecond steps. As the monkey fixated centrally, two patches of moving high 
contrast square wave grating were presented at equal eccentricity, one inside 
and one one outside the receptive field (RF) of the recorded neurons. On 
alternate trials, the monkey was cued to attend to either one of them. At ~115 
ms poststimulus, there was a brief increase in gamma power, peaking ~65 Hz. The 
gamma power peak was accompanied by a peak in coherence among a subset of 
recording sites. At ~160&nbsp;ms poststimulus, a second coherence peak occurred at 
~45&nbsp;Hz, but with no corresponding power peak. Attention to the stimulus inside 
the recorded neurons' RF enhanced the observed gamma power and coherence. These 
results support the idea that attention biases competition among visual stimuli 
in favor of those that are behaviorally relevant (Desimone &amp; Duncan, Ann Rev 
Neurosci, 1995), and suggest that increased gamma frequency synchronization to 
attended stimuli may enhance the impact of activated V4 neurons on their 
targets. The AMVAR method was instrumental in revealing the dynamics of gamma 
frequency synchronization with high temporal and frequency resolution.</p>
