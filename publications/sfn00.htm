<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Macaque monkeys were trained to perform a visuomotor pattern 
discrimination task based on differences in visual pattern. Local field 
potentials recorded simultaneously from striate cortex, prestriate cortex and 
inferior temporal cortex were examined on a millisecond time scale. With the use 
of an analysis based on multivariate regression theory, we found that during 
processing of right or left slanted diamond or line patterns, bi-directional 
flow of neural information between cortical areas occurred with different onset 
timing. The flow of visual information originated in striate cortex, diverged 
within prestriate cortex, and coursed into the inferior temporal cortex. By 
contrast, a reversed-direction information flow, with delayed onset at each 
stage, was observed. Furthermore, these bi-directional information flows were 
predominant at 12 Hz.Our results clearly show dual dynamical interactions, 
occurring in the alpha range, between cortical areas at three hierarchical 
levels in the visual system. These dynamic interactions may subserve bottom-up 
and top-down functions postulated by many theories of visual perception.
